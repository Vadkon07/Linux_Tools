This code can be very useful for a new Linux users, which don't know or don't remember some Linux terminal commands. You just run this code, enter number of command, and he is running this command in your terminal. In the bottom you can add a reminder of a executed command.

Commands inside him are only for example. You have to customize this code and add in him even more command, even 100+!
